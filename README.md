# Blood-Bank-Management-System


Blood Bank Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed using Java Swing (JFrame), MySQL database, and NetBeans IDE. It is designed to manage and streamline the operations of a blood donation system in a simple and user-friendly manner.

The system includes a secure login page for admin and donor authentication. Once logged in, the user is taken to the home page where all functionalities are accessible through navigation buttons.

The application allows administrators to add new donor information including personal and contact details. It also provides features to update donor details and view all registered donor information in a structured format.

Users can search for donors either by their blood group or by location to find a match quickly and efficiently. The system also maintains the stock levels of different blood groups. It has options to increase or decrease blood stock depending on availability and requirement.

A separate section is available to view current stock details, making it easier for blood bank staff to manage inventory. The application also includes the ability to delete donor records when necessary.

The Blood Bank Management System is aimed at improving the efficiency of blood bank operations, ensuring quick access to donor data, and maintaining accurate stock records through a responsive and clean GUI. It is ideal for use in hospitals, donation camps, and clinics that require a reliable blood management system.
